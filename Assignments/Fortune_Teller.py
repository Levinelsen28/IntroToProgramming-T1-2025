1. **Fortune Teller Setup**
    
    Introduce the fortune teller, who will ask for different numbers to provide mystical insights.
    
2. **Input Prompts with Type Requirements**
    
    The fortune teller asks for the user to input numbers to tell the fortune. You can ask any questions you want for this, but here are some examples:
    
    - Ask for the playerâ€™s **lucky number** (expects an integer).
    - Ask how many **years into the future** they want to see (expects a float).
    - Ask for a **magical multiplier** (expects a float).
3. **Error Handling Using try and except**
    
    Use try and except to:
    
    - Catch errors if the player inputs the wrong type.
    - Restart the function when an error occurs
4. Read out the fortune
    
    Take the input numbers and a random number to calculate the fortune.
